LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface application. 
It relies on user input similar to SIR but it executes from the command line. 
LIRI uses several APIs to process user requests; Spotify, OMDB and Bands In Town API. 
The Spotify API returns artist's songs information and it executes by typing 'spotify-this' in the command line. 
OMDB gives the user movie information and it is executed by typing 'movie-this' in the command line. 
Lastly the Bands In Town API informs the user of artist's concerts by typing 'concert-this' in the command line.
